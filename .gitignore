# Laravel specific files inside the 'src' directory that should NOT be pushed
# The Laravel project itself should have its own .gitignore inside src/
/src/.env           # Laravel's main environment file with app keys, DB details etc. DO NOT PUSH.
/src/vendor/        # Composer dependencies in Laravel project

/src/public/hot     # Laravel Mix/Vite HMR file
/src/public/storage # Symlink for storage files (usually managed by artisan storage:link)
/src/storage/*.key  # Laravel's encryption keys
/src/storage/*.log  # Laravel's log files
/src/bootstrap/cache/*.php # Laravel's cached files

# Files that SHOULD be part of the repository (exceptions to broader ignores)
# These are implicitly tracked by Git if not matched by preceding rules,
# but can be explicitly included if needed. For your current structure,
# docker-compose.yml and the docker/ folder's contents should be pushed.
# Your current .gitignore already ensures these are tracked by using '!'
#
# !docker-compose.yml    # No need for '!' if it's not ignored by other patterns
# !docker/nginx/
# !docker/php/
# !.dockerignore         # If you have a .dockerignore in the root
